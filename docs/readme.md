## High Level
- The ATD editor addon hosts other addons within it's UI, in its menus and tabs. The addons in the menu are then called for action, and their UI is displayed within the tabs.

- This addon give the ability to configure Transactions/Activities/Accounts Types.

 - Transaction Types: allow you to create sales transactions (ex. Invoice, Return, Quote, Future Order). For each type you can customize every aspect of the process - the Cart, the Order PDF, header/footer of Order PDF, how items are summarized, as well as email notifications, file export, and integration Workflow triggered by an order status change, sharing settings and more.

 - Activities Types: allow you to add your own customized Activity forms. Create an Activity type, select an icon for it, create a form and add the fields required. Activities can then be added to the Sales Teams Activities and Menu.

 - Account Types: allow you to categorize your Accounts by type such as Customers, Van customers, Warehouses, etc. and segment by user profile. Define the name of the Account type and which fields should be displayed on its information form. The Account types can then be added to lists per user profile.
